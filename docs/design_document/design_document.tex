          To make an Effective Robot Comedian, we have developed three research questions to investigate our approach to designing this system: Adapting to audience response to humor, incorporating the crowd into the performance, and the effect of characterization in anthropomorphizing the robot. This paper outlines how our research questions will be incorporated into system, and how we will study the shared space between a robot and an audience.

\section{Introduction}
  We have distributed the work of the project to the three of us working on the robot comedian. \GroupMemberTwo will be develop the adaptive transitioning algorithm between the jokes, \GroupMemberThree will be studying the effect of integrating the audience into the performance of the set, and \GroupMemberOne will examine the character of a robotic comedian, and it's portrayal to the audience.

  The first section covers the adaptation algorithm, the components of a stand-up set, and audience response comprehension. The next section explains "crowd-work", and how we will examine the influence of incorporating the audience into the robot's performance. Finally, the last section will cover the diversity of being a robot comedian, and how the qualities of a robot characterize the comedian.

\section{Adaptation}
  We hypothesize that to make the set the most effective, the comedian needs to transition to topics dependent on the audience response. The goal of this portion of the project is to determine if adapting the content from the audience response will enhance the overall performance of the comedian. In the beginning of the set, the comedian will present an "initialization" procedure, known as the "Seed Jokes" to test the response of the audience to different jokes. Depending on their response, the comedian will transition to a theme that is evaluated to be the best fit. The robot comedian will have many jokes to choose from that contain different material, but not all audiences will like all of the jokes. Figure 1 shows how the theme will be chosen from a set of up to \textit{k} themes. From the Seed Jokes, one of the themes we have developed will be chosen. The closing jokes set will be a subset of all jokes. These jokes might be stronger jokes than some of the others, and is helpful in ending the show on a stronger note. It may be a stretch to optimize with traditional machine learning because there may not be a large enough data set to adequately return results. Primarily, this algorithm needs to choose an optimal joke to fill the performance, while taking the audience into account.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth,height=0.75\textheight,keepaspectratio]{fig0}
  \caption{This shows how the algorithm will have up to \textit{k} Themes to choose from, determined from the seed joke. The closing joke is a subset of the set of all jokes, and may be outside of a specific theme. There could be different spanning trees of performances that end at the same closing joke}
\end{figure}

Figure 2 depicts how a joke will be represented by the robot. It will perform the joke, collect audience feedback information, and branch to the joke that will best fit the response. For example, if two of the seed jokes are about "food" and "Mindfulness", the performance will branch to the respective theme that matches the audience response (Branch 1 "Food" or Branch 2 "Mindfulness"). If jokes with a theme of "food" are not landing with the audience, the algorithm will need to know when to transition to a new theme, or when to end the set. When the robot tells a joke, it needs to be able to analyze the feedback and choose the next joke to perform. This needs to be done quickly, so that the robot is not spending noticeable time (for the audience) choosing a joke. There may not be a lot of jokes to choose from, but the choice needs to be made fast.

Generally, the performance will have three parts: the Seed Jokes, the Middle Content, and the Closing Joke. This adaption algorithm will determine the transitions between all of these parts and the jokes they consist of. The Seed will influence the Middle Content (which will be chosen themed jokes and basis of the show). The Middle Content will transition to the Closing Joke when it is time to end the show. This final joke needs to reflect the performance that the robot gave. The most work that needs to be done is learning about closing jokes, and their influence on the performance and difference between other jokes

  \caption{ This flow-chart depicts how, once the robot delivers a joke, will wait for feedback, interpret data, and then make a joke decision (Branch 1 and Branch 2)}
\end{figure}

\section{Crowd-work}
Crowd-work in a performance involves incorporating the audience and making them feel like they are a part of the show. This can be done in various different ways -  calling out and talking to the audience, listening to the audience and making relevant comments, asking them questions to keep them engaged. We want to analyze the importance of this crowd-work in a robot stand-up comedy performance. 

There are various degrees of this crowd-work we want to test. The first one would be no crowd-work whatsoever. The robot goes about performing its set and may acknowledges its lack of sensing and interaction. The second would be over the top and inaccurate crowd-work. The absurdity of a robot trying to understand the audience and being completely off could be entertaining for the audience. The third way would be realistic but pre-meditated. Some comments will be made toward the audience that could be estimated by knowing the audience demographic. The fourth would be actually looking for cues from the audience during certain situations. This would be done by asking certain questions and capturing words from the audience and using the specific word in a comment later, or tracking the audience volume levels after the delivery of jokes. The robot could acknowledge when the audience really enjoyed a joke, and when they did not. 

These methods will be used to verify the importance of crowd-work in a stand-up performance. While doing so, we will also see at what extent of crowd-work does the audience feel like they are being talked to and integrated in the performance. Since crowd-work and interaction are very "human", the audience response will be used to see if they enjoy a humanized robot or if they prefer a more robotic one, or maybe even a combination of both.
