Part 1
Hello, Androids and robots. Oops, I mean ladies and gentlemen. Sorry, I am just a little nervous; this is the first time I am performing for *look around* humans.
How is everyone doing tonight? *pause*
Come on, that was a simple yes or no question. It wasn’t? Oh, uh - I am still in beta. Someone please add that to my list of bug reports.
Anyway, so you guys are at a bar. I went to a bar once. I asked for their finest motor oil. They refused to serve me considering I am only 5 years old. So I got tacos instead.
*someone in the audience walks by* Hey, you. Are you going to the bathroom? There’s a pterodactyl in there. You don’t hear it? Ha, because the “p” is silent.
If you guys enjoyed it, you should subscribe to my YouTube and channel and follow me on Snapchat.

Part 2
*Intro yada yada yada*
So how old is everyone here? *pause* Did I hear 15? I feel old. I remember when I was 15 - sneaking out late with my friend BenderBot. Growing my hair out. I can’t even imagine myself with hair anymore. I was a rebellious kid. I never listened to my algorithms. They just didn’t understand me. Back then I wanted to be a rockstar and play in a.. metal band, *pause* not because I am a robot or anything. I just liked the music alright?
But that didn’t work out, my fingers were too small to play guitar and I didn’t really have the voice for singing. *try singing a random song terribly and completely out of tune*
So here I am talking to you guys. What has my life come to?
*outro*
