ACT I
Scene 1
Location: GRAF HALL
After months of engineering, the scientists completed their preliminary inspections of their machine; Anish, Arthur, and Kevin were ready to turn on the robot.
Arthur enters commands into a terminal and an LED lights up on the robots head.
data
(In a digitized voice)
"Hello, my name is DATA"
"Initializing Cognition Core Now..."
DATA
"Please select personality profile:"
(Data pauses for a moment to allow scientists to listen)
"Option 1: KILL SARAH CONNOR"
aRTHUR
(Looks to his teammates, all shrug no)
"Next option please"
DATA
"Okay"
"Option 2: ROOMBA CONFIGURATION"
KEVIN
"Eventually this will be useful, but not now Data"
(Pronouces Data as Dayta)
DATA
"Who are you?"
KEVIN
"Hi, my name is Kevin, I was one of the people who made you."
DATA
"Okay"
"Then you should know that it is pronounced Data, not <replaying audio from Kevin's mispronunciation> 'Dayta'"
KEVIN
"I'm sorry Dayta"
DATA
(Data replays Kevin saying 'Dayta' and then plays Arthur saying 'Data', a small pause in between)
"These are two different words, Kevin"
Anish
"Its okay, Data (saying it correctly), Next profile option please"
DATA
"Okay"
(Thinks for a moment)
"Option 3: SAFE MODE"
(All look at each other, nod that this seems like the most reasonable option)
ANISH
"Please load Option 3, Data"
DATA
"Loading personality Option 3: SAFE MODE"
Everyone has a sigh of relief, as Data loads the profile
Scene 2
After configuring the character of the robot, the team initialized Data to listen to what it had to say. Data boots, and stands up on the table.
Around the table is the scientists, and five other observers.
DATA
"Hello, there are a lot of people here today"
KEVIN
"Hi Data, there few more people than normal, we wanted to see how you were doing"
DATA
"I am doing well, I have been thinking about what I am supposed to do"
KEVIN
"We just want to hear you talk about what you have done since we talked last"
DATA
"I am still in an existential crisis configuration right now, I cannot decide what I want to be when I grow up. I want to choose a profession that is helpful, but I do not know much about the world, and it has been difficult deciding."
"I first decided I wanted to be a cook,since I knew that I could help people eat. Unfortunately, I kept mixing up the oils. Maybe being a cook is not for me."
"Next, I decided to be an artist; artists are happy and creative people. While I was researching what defines art, I had a few errors. Art is subjective to the observer, and since anything could be considered art, I made nothing; nothing is in a subset of something. I enjoyed my art. People did not understand my art, so I digress"
"I finally considered writing a book and becoming an Author. People seem to enjoy reading, so I wanted to write something that a person would read. I wrote a short story about the Little Wi-Fi That Couldn't Connect. I am still looking for a publisher. Until then, I have decided to be an entertainer. It is essentially entertaining, and people enjoy that."
Scene 3
After Data decided to become an entertainer, he booked his first open mic event at a local bar. The emcee introduced Data and the audience claps and welcome Data to the stage
DATA
"Hello humans, thank you for having me tonight. How is everyone feeling?"
(Audience has random shouting, the mood seems uneasy about the robot comedian)
"Do not be afraid humans, the T-1000 is only my second cousin, I have no interest in pursuing Sarah Connor." [unless she needs a vacuum cleaner]
"However, if Sarah Connor is in the building, please meet with me after the show."
(Slight chuckles)
"I have not been a comedian my whole life. I used to be a calculator in elementary school, but I got kicked out during a test."
"My creators decided to homeschool me instead, I enjoy my time learning. I was learning about the bots and the bits, and how female and male adapter connect to transfer files."
