\subsection{Modified Requirements}
In terms of modified requirements, some of our existing requirements were deleted because they were infeasible to complete in time.
Requirements that were changed include the coherent vs. incoherent character research area. This was modified slowly into the robot vs. human research area, as it was too hard to create an entertaining comedy set with an incoherent comedian. In addition, it became clear at some point in the project that doing multiple official tests would be infeasible, so we decided to do all our tests unofficially at the Engineering Expo.
