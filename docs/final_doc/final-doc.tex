			The purpose of this document is to outline the research papers that this team will create to conclude during Spring Term 2018.
			The three members of the \textit{Short Circut Comedy Club} have spent their time during winter term perfomring research under Dr. Heather Knight at Oregon State University.
			The focus of this project is to study the effect a robot comedian can have on a crowd of humans.
			Kevin Talik's research has been spent understanding what a Comedian can do to "Adapt" to a performance.
			Arthur Shing has been studying the voice of the robot, and the difference between "Robot and Human" character.
			One final aspect of Stand-Up Comedy that we studied is "Crowd Work". Anish Asrani has spent most of his time developing spontaneous Crowd-Interactions during the set.

\begin{description}
  \item [Algorithm] \hfill \\ The software program that receives input to make an optimized choice; in this project, the algorithm is in context to the adaptation program.
  \item [Animating] \hfill \\ The NAO robot can be programmed to animate and move while speaking. This can be used to improve non-verbal communication between the robot and the audience.
  \item [API] \hfill \\ Application Programming Interface
  \item [Branch] \hfill \\Looking at the graph (edges and nodes) of a performance, a branch is a decision choice made by the algorithm.
  \item [Choregraphe] \hfill \\ Software used to program behavior and performance sets, made by SoftBank Robotics
  \item [Closing Joke] \hfill \\The final joke in a performance; this is helpful if it is a successful joke to end on a good note.
  \item [Crowd-work] \hfill \\ Part of a Comedian's performance that involves content from the current audience
  \item [HRI] \hfill \\ Human-Robot interaction
  \item [NAO] \hfill \\ Model of Robot that will be used as the Comedian Agent, made by SoftBank Robotics
  \item [SDK] \hfill \\ Software Development Kit
  \item [SoftBank Robotics] \hfill \\ Manufacturer of the NAO robot, NAOqi API, and Choregraphe software
  \item [Seed Jokes] \hfill \\ Set of three jokes that initialize the adaptation algorithm.
  \item [Set] \hfill \\Short for "Stand-up" set; this may also be used to describe to the collection of jokes: "A Set of Jokes"
  \item [Tree] \hfill \\This is the path through the set of jokes the algorithm took during a performance
