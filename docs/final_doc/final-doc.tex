			The purpose of this document is to outline the research papers that this team will create to conclude during Spring Term 2018.
			The three members of the \textit{Short Circut Comedy Club} have spent their time during winter term perfomring research under Dr. Heather Knight at Oregon State University.
			The focus of this project is to study the effect a robot comedian can have on a crowd of humans.
			Kevin Talik's research has been spent understanding what a Comedian can do to "Adapt" to a performance.
			Arthur Shing has been studying the voice of the robot, and the difference between "Robot and Human" character.
			One final aspect of Stand-Up Comedy that we studied is "Crowd Work". Anish Asrani has spent most of his time developing spontaneous Crowd-Interactions during the set.

\section{Technical Resources}

    The NAOqi API was challenging to work with. The documentation is scarce, all over the place, and often outdated.
    Some of the example code is in C++, while some is in Python. This makes it hard to interpret what each of the functions do.
    However, using it is the only way to operate the robot without using the clunky Choregrahe GUI. 
    The NAOqi API came particularly handy during the shows and helped launch behaviors without much delay, unlike Choregraphe. \\
    Setting up the NAOqi SDK was a doozy in itself. For setting it up on a Mac, it needs to run on the built-in Python version, 
    NOT the one from the official Python website. This is fine, but it does not work with the built-in Python version on the latest versions of OS X.
    While not knowing this, and trying to get around it took a while, there is a Bash script \cite{BashScript}
    that "fixes" the Python installation to match the NAOqi requirements. \\
    There are similar issues with the NAOqi SDK on Ubuntu 16.04 (and probably other versions as well). StackOverflow had some takes 
    on what could fix the issue. \cite{naoUbuntu}

\section{Final Team Conclusions}
\subsection{Kevin Talik}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{What technical information did you learn?}}

    I learned how to perform research, and define gaps in current research.
    Research is not entirely about doing something completely new, but searching through current research to find a "Gap".
    There can be a lot of pressure to deliver results from research, but it is far more important to understand the premise of collecting data.
    These projects can scale out of scope if the final method for collecting information is not clearly defined in the beginning.

    Additionally, I learned that there are tasks robots can do, and tasks robots should do.
    There is never a situation where you should value a robot over a human.
    Comparing "Robots vs Humans" insinuates that there is a moment where they could be equal.
    AI is not a species, but a tool that humans can use as an end through means.

    Robot comedy is identical to ventriloquism.
    We write the words and motions that the robot re-enacts.
    Kids, and people who do not understand \texttt{if-else} statements think that AI is making decisions.
    If the robot offends people with a joke, we, as the comedians, must take ownership of the robot's decisions.
    A robot should not be making ethical decisions of what to say in front of a crowd.


\item{\textbf{What non-technical information did you learn?}}


    People laugh when they see something, and are surprised and \textit{comfortable}.
    Also, people force a laugh when they are surprised and \textit{uncomfortable}.
    Listening to laughter alone can be a bad metric for comedy, as it is hard to tell when people are laughing at you, or with you.

    There is no truth to comedy, it is a written art that people study to find what makes people comfortable.
    When people are laughing, they are not paying attention to the computer that is inside of the robot.
    Comedy is a \textit{very} persuasive form of communication, and finding when a human is comfortable is not a task a robot should have.


\item{\textbf{What have you learned about project work?}}

    Project work is primarily time-dependent; however, there are always different expectations about how much time a person can give \cite{theMythicalManMonth}.
    Software must be planned in a scalable manner so that it does not fall ahead or behind scope during implementation.
    The work a person does must be human-readable, and easy to understand.
    This is so that when another person looks at what you've done, it is easier and faster for them to connect larger concepts.
    This must be balanced with a healthy, and sustainable personal life balance.
    Stress is a normal thing that humans have to deal with, and avoiding it brings more stress.




\item{\textbf{What have you learned about project management?}}

    The fundamentals of a good team is honest, and healthy communication.
    Our team functioned well when we all treated each other with respect.
    Patience is important in software. It is unreasonable to assume everyone knows everything.
    Lift as you climb, and help your team.


\item{\textbf{What have you learned about working in teams?}}

        For the success of a comedy show, a team must be heavily involved with every portion of a performance.
        Machines that are built alone, work alone. Coding standards exist so that similar looking projects look the same.
        "camelCasing" or "underscore\_casing" is unified so that a team can write similar looking code.
        There is always enough time for one person to do an entire project, but it is not a single-human task.
        Our final project got much better once we worked together in the same room.


\item{\textbf{If you could do it all over, what would you do differently?}}

    I would have designed test cases before we started implementing.
    This is so that when code is written, it can be evaluated with specifications that are made during the design phase.
    Projects can fall out of scope when there are more features added with pre-existing work to be done.
    I think that our performance needed to have equally distributed testing (performing jokes) with implementing (writing jokes).
    Virtual systems can add many more states than physical systems, and proper testing practices should be developed before the project starts.
