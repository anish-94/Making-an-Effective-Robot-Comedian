        The purpose of this project is to make a robot that performs comedy. Robot interaction lacks the traits of human interaction. Character, authenticity, and liveliness are some traits of human interaction that enables people to stay invested in an interaction, and are important aspects of successful stand-up comedy. In an effort to create an effective robot comedian, these traits should be present in the robot. The challenge will be to make the robot feel and perform more like a human would while keeping the audience engaged. This can be overcome by considering audience feedback after every joke or story that is told and using artificial intelligence to adjust future jokes. We propose that the robot should be able to construct its own jokes according to these traits, and also in accordance with audience reaction. The robot’s performance will be measured using audience sensing tools.

\section{The Problem}

\begin{quote}
``The jostling of ideas... produces a physical jostling of our internal organs and we enjoy that physical stimulation.'' - John Morreall
\end{quote}
Humor is an entertaining break in expectations and can happen in any interaction. The element of incongruity has long been acknowledged to be an essential part of humor, and has been noted by philosophers such as Aristotle and Kant {\cite{StanfordHum:2016}}. A form of modern comedy that capitalizes on this element of incongruity is stand-up comedy.

In stand-up comedy, comedians have to rely on their scripted jokes and their ability to improvise to have a successful performance. In many ways, a robot interaction can be compared to a stand-up set. Within the context of stand up comedy, a robot must be receptive to an audience and tell jokes to make an audience laugh.

Why is the field of robot comedy relevant and worth studying? With automation slowly replacing menial tasks in society, some robots, such as an ATM or an automated cashier, require successful interactions to complete their task. These machines are not fun to interact with, and the interaction is less significant. While these machines do improve ease of use and convenience, people do not expect them to be expressive or have a coherent character.

Even if the machine is unsuccessful in completing its task, expressive robots are received in a more empathetic manner by the users.{\cite{DesignExBeh:2017}}.

There have been studies on the comedic value of jokes told by a robot. In one study, Sjöbergh and Araki {\cite{RobotsMakeThings:2008}} examined the significance of having a robot tell a joke. However, this study evaluated joke performance by a robot, but not an entire stand-up set. In addition, another study by Katevas et al. {\cite{RobotComedyLab:2015}} evaluated the influence of non-verbal aspects of joke delivery. To extend on these lines of research, we intend to focus on the effect of verbally and physically expressing robot character qualities during a stand-up performance.

While robots can perform comedy to some extent, there is still a significant gap between human and robot performances. One of the biggest factors leading to this is that robots have limitations detecting and reacting to the dynamics of the audience behavior {\cite{KatevasRobot:2014}}. This may go unnoticed in shorter sets but when performing for extended periods, it would become prominent and could potentially leave the audience uninterested.

Existing research with robot comedians has given rise to the questions of the nature of comedy: What does robot comedy need to succeed? What is it that makes a performance engaging and alive? How might comedy exclusive to a robotic comedian improve its act {\cite{RobotsMakeThings:2008}}? To answer these questions, we hypothesize that a performance is enhanced when (1) the comedian interacts spontaneously with the audience, (2) the comedian has and conveys a coherent, well-developed character, and (3) the comedian adapts its act to cater to an audience based on their reaction.



%We are trying to make a robot that performs stand-up comedy and entertain people. This should be done while making the robot as close to human as possible. The comedy routine will be scripted but there should be some sort of interactions between jokes to make the performance feel more real. The audience should feel engaged throughout the performance.



\section{Proposed Solution}

To make robot comedy successful, we propose that conveying character through improvisational dialogue will make the comedian-audience interaction feel authentic and engaging. We intend to evaluate an audience's experience during a robot comedy set to interpret how a robot’s character is received.

	In a final performance, the audience who should be responsive to the robot comedian, and the robot should adaptively communicate a set of jokes to the audience. To build up to this, the robot should functionally tell jokes as a persona, and then view how a live audience responds to the delivery. Additionally, parameters can be set as to how interactive and adaptive the robot will be on stage, as well as the sort of character it will have. In order to make this feasible, some steps will first be taken locally and remotely.

	Locally in our group, we will determine what a robot can be technically limited to, and learn how to structure the software behind character parameters and verbal sentences. Through this process, we can design jokes and set segments. We will also design character personas that the robot will use, and test sets ourselves with our friends and peers to ensure the hilarity of the set.

	Remotely and outside of our group, after sets and personas are developed we will test how our jokes are communicating to the audience. Remote testing may be done, involving pre-recorded videos and testing with an online audience. Sets will be scripted and non-adaptive, such that revisions to sets can be made to further ensure that our sets are indeed hilarious. Sets may include scripted quasi-spontaneous interactions with the audience. Additionally, in line with work done by Katevas et al. {\cite{RobotComedyLab:2015}} and Sj{\"o}bergh and Araki {\cite{RobotsMakeThings:2008}}, the robot should make use of non-verbal cues. This includes looking at the audience while talking to them, making appropriate hand gestures to supplement the jokes, and walking back and forth on stage. These aspects of body language will help keep the audience engaged and give the robot a human touch.

	After remote testing is completed, field tests in the real world will be run. Our robot performance will make sets dynamically, and observe audiences to choose jokes adaptively; the robot will be socially intelligent. We also hope to compare the responses to jokes performed by the robot against the same jokes performed by a human. Once we can see how an audience interacts with a robot, we want to observe decisions that the robot can make to engage the audience and adapt to measured responses.


\section{Performance Metrics}

Broad metrics involved will include the audience’s evaluation of the robot’s character and response to jokes. We also need to measure the robot’s ability to deliver jokes and adapt to how the audience responds.

The robot will be tested by giving it different personas at different performances. To see if the robot’s character was conveyed coherently, the audience will fill out a questionnaire prompting them to describe its character, as well as some humanizing questions, e.g. “Would you invite this robot to dinner?” These responses will be used to study if the robot matched the expected persona and gauge how comfortable the people are with the robot.

Audience response to jokes will also be measured by behavioral observation. With consent, the audience may be recorded for their reactions, such that responses can be retrospectively observed to see which parts of the set worked and which parts were less successful.
