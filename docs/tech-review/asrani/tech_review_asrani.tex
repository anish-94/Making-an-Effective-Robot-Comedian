A comedian can observe an audience and improvise a delivery of a joke to connect the audience to the content. This makes the experience more authentic and genuine for the observer. The purpose of this project is to to discover what makes an entertaining interaction by studying a robot that performs comedy. We propose that a performance is enhanced when (1) the comedian interacts spontaneously with the audience, (2) the comedian has and conveys a coherent, well-developed character, and (3) the comedian adapts its act to cater to an audience based on their reaction. This document covers the technical requirements for our project, as well as a description of software, hardware, and outside limitations.

\section{Introduction}
A performer's ability to influence the audience is vital to an entertaining performance. This involves correctly tying together various social signals such as body orientation, gesture, and gaze by both the performers and audience. \cite{RobotComedyLab:2015}. Dr. Knight also emphasized on the importance of such non-verbal interactions in order to deliver a successful performance \cite{KnightEightLessons:2011}. We want to take this further and incorporate a fair amount of crowd-work and audience interactions in order to make the performance enjoyable and engaging. 

\section{Literature Review}
The timing, frequency, and duration of a gesture relays a lot of information to the spectator. Dr. Knight conducted various performances with a robot, ranging from performing on stage with an audience to pre-mediated collisions with human environments, like "street performances." Over the course of these performances, there were eight major takeaways that will help make a robot performance entertaining. They were:

\subsection{Convey Intentionality}
Using relatable and appropriate gestures help the communication between the robot and the audience. Since these actions can be predicted by the audience, they consider the robot as an entity similar to them. Displaying empathy while performing also boosts the robot's relatability to the audience.

\subsection{No Mind Without Body}
Human expressions are derived from our physicality. Robots can also be capable of leveraging their embodiment to communicate on human terms. It was found that presence of a physical, embodied robot enabled more interaction as well as enjoyment of said interaction for humans. A robot not fully leveraging its physicality ends up losing a significant mode of communication and is also less expressive.
	
\subsection{Physicality and Motion}
The audience should be able to connect the robot's non-verbal behaviors to the words. The human brain maps the actions it sees on to itself and imagines itself doing it. This helps the audience put themselves in the shoes of the performer. 

\subsection{Outward Emotional Communication Trumps Inward Experience}
Simplicity and clean physical design is often the clearest way to streamline communication of robot intention. Most robots are designed to enhance, enable, or empower humans. The inner experience of the robot is trumped by the success of the outward interaction loop.

\subsection{Gulf between Props and Character}
Robots should be considered to be more like agents (entities) and less like a prop just standing up on stage. Until now, robots have been lacking in that department and there is a significant gap present. The robots lack believable and human-like actions. The various aspects of non-verbal communication like gestures have a significant impact on the robot not being considered an object.

\subsection{Good Actors Outweigh Bad Actors}
Multi-robot or human-robot teams have potential to deliver entertaining performances. Human actors can affect the audience's perception of the robot. They can also make up for the robot's unpredictability and lack of control.

\subsection{Acknowledging/Learning}
Human audiences are cognizant of human social behaviors. The audience can provide real time feedback. This feedback can be used to maximize the audience's enjoyment levels. The robot can constantly read these enjoyment levels and update the attributes of audience likes and dislikes. When delivering a joke, the audience should be given enough time to comprehend and process the joke. Starting the next joke early can break the flow and does not give the audience a chance to appreciate the joke and its delivery. The pause could be filled with the robot gazing around at the audience and posing. This helps develop a good rhythm for each joke.

\subsection{Humor Makes People Like the Robot }
Humor is one of the common grounds across all humans. When a robot performs comedy, and is able to match their sense of humor, it helps establish that common ground. IF humor can help robot seem like ?one of us', that could be a significant leap to overcome the idea that robots are only props \cite{KnightEightLessons:2011}.


Katevas conducted studies in a similar fashion. His study hypothesized that interactional dynamics should be just as important to the mass interaction involved in performing comedy in front of a live audience. The interactional dynamics involved addressing the audience ? including an appropriately timed smile or relevant gesture. The interactional procedures during a performance helps set the tone for the performance. 

Robots provide a unique opportunity to experiment with the interactional processes. They can have a consistent routine while modifying the various aspects of delivery ? body orientation, gaze, and gesture. 

Embodied robots are likely the best way for the robot the catch the audience attention and make the audience pay attention to the robot. The robot used by Katevas et. al was a humanoid robot consisting of a robotic head, two arms with hands, the torso as well as two legs. The head had two rectangular LCD screens for eyes as well as LEDs on cheeks for expression \cite{RobotComedyLab:2015}.	

\section{Methods}

Katevas' studies involved two performances. Each performance involved a compere doing the introductions and warming up the crowd for 10 minutes, followed by a human comedian performing for 13 minutes. Right after that, the robot comedian performed for 8 minutes. This format was used to widen the appeal of the event and to set up a stand-up comedy context. Each performance consisted of approximately 50 people in the audience. The sensors used to capture audience reactions and responses got data for approximately 20 people each performance. These sensors looked for various aspects about the audience including gender and age estimation. It also captured facial expressions and categorizing them into percentages of "happy", "sad", "angry", and "surprised". It considered these factors throughout its performance.

Punchlines were distinguished using a faster delivery followed by a short pause. The punchline was also followed by a gaze and a smile and sometimes laughter. The duration of the pause was determined by the feedback received from the joke - a longer pause if the audience is still laughing. While using gestures, a gesture pointing to the audience at certain times seemed to get the most positive feedback \cite{RobotComedyLab:2015}.

Dr. Knight's research was more varied. Her performances ranged from stage and audience performances like Katevas, and also guerrilla theater performances (street performances). The research looked to add value to developing everyday robots in addition to the entertainment value. It is easy to survey people and learn more about human-robot interaction when there is a significant amount of people present in the audience. 

Using the theater context also helps the development of social robots. As noted before, non-verbal expression plays a key role in understanding sociability. A robot's movement and engagement pattern impacts the people's interpretation of the robot's intention, capability, and state. Physical theater provides pre-processed methodologies for interpreting and communicating human non-verbal behaviors that can be portrayed on robots \cite{KnightEightLessons:2011}.

\section{Results}

Dr. Knight's research helped provide a deeper understanding of how intentional or coincidental robot actions might impact human perception. The eight lessons learned also emphasize the impact of various non-verbal communication methods in conveying an idea \cite{KnightEightLessons:2011}.


\section{Discussion}


\section{Conclusion}

It will be important to make the audience feel like they are a part of the performance at all times. This will ensure that they are kept engrossed throughout the performance.
