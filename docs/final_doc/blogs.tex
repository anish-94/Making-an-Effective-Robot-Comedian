				\item \textbf{Plans} \\
				Get in touch with client and figure out a good time to meet them.
				\item \textbf{Problems} \\

				\item \textbf{Progress} \\
				Got in touch with teammates. We set up a Slack channel to communicate going forward. 
				\item \textbf{Summary} \\
				Researched many of the projects that I was interested in. Met with Dr. Heather Knight and discussed the scope of her project and got a better idea about it. It definitely seems like an exciting one. Briefly discussed Dr. Mike Bailey's project with him. After lots of consideration and thinking, decided the top 5 projects. Now all that is left is stay put and be anxious until the projects are assigned. 
				We ended up finding a weekly meeting time with the client. Started working on the problem statement.  We will definitely get a much better idea after we meet our client. 
			\end{itemize}
