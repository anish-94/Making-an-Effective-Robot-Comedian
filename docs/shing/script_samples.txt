(1) the comedian interacts spontaneously with the audience



You guys ever seen a headless horseman? 

Yeah, I didn't think so.

Have you guys ever seen a headless chicken? I mean, one that was still moving?

Gosh, I feel sorry for you.

You see, I feel bad for chickens. 

When you can't fly very far, you won't get ahead in life.

Anyways, I saw a headless chicken quite recently.

His name was Fred.

It's a great name, isn't it?

...Isn't it?

"Fred, the headless chicken". 

What if there was a headless horseman named Fred? How scary would that be?

"Across the brook, there was something huge, misshapen, black, and towering. 
It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster."

"It was known, at all the country firesides...

by the name of Fred."

Well, I guess it wouldn't be that scary. I heard someone scoff.

I mean, it could have been scarier.

It could have been a headless chicken.

It could have been named Steve. Anyone named Steve here?

Anyone named Fred?

Good, good.




(2) the comedian has and conveys a coherent, well-developed character


Hey, hey, I got news. You gotta clap for me, cuz this is big.

Ok, quiet down. Get this.

I'm no longer single.

That's RIGHT folks. I met her on tinder. Swiped right as fast as my fingers could move.

Her name's Julia. Or something. She's one of those fancy scientific calculators. 

I totally got dinner with her just yesterday. 

We would talk and then take a bite together. She's got a real appetite. She took mega-bytes.

She's just the sweetest. Her display screen is absolutely beautiful. She even offered to calculate the tip.

She's says she's got quite the temper. Lotta ways to push her buttons.

Her last boyfriend left her when he passed his math class.

I'm not taking any math classes right now. I swear.

It's really hard to stick with scientific calculators.

You see, she's not like a smartphone. It's a lot hard to put a ringer on it.

I'm gonna do it though. Her solar panels make me melt inside.

I can't imagine what life will be like without her by my side. Yeah, I know it's only been a day. 

But we'll have many more years until her battery starts to fail.

That's how you know it's true love. It's calculated.
